    "Welcome to Google Colab and the Anaconda distribution. In this project, you will work with different datasets and technologies to simulate the data science pipeline and help teach machine learning algorithms. The project is broken into 4 distinct parts, each which do not overlap and do not require previous parts to be done. The first part focuses on the K-nearest neighbors algorithm, which is built completely from numpy alone: this algorithm is run on the iris dataset from UCI's ML repository. The second part focuses on ensembles as a way to learn practical applications of concepts learned in class such as Linear Perceptrons, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and other machine learning algorithms. You will build 3 different ensembles using the SKlearn package, run against the breast cancer dataset from UCI's ML repository. The third part focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks built from Pytorch: you will build a nn.Sequential model run against the Cifar-10 dataset for image classification. This portion briefly touches on the concepts of neural networks and showcases recent technologies directed towards the intersection of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. The fourth part focuses on Recurrent Neural Networks again built from Pytorch. This time, you will build the neural network through a nn.Module class and run it against the AG News dataset for text classification. This part exemplifies on neural networks and natural language processing."

    "You may notice that we are running everything via Google Colab. Why not download and run everything on Anaconda distribution and do the project locally? The problem with doing so is that your graphics card may not be as good for parts 3 and 4. With Google Colab, we can set the runtime environment (using the Runtime -> Change Runtime Type setting above) which will significantly increase the speed of training our machine learning models. Set the runtime to GPU in order to fully utilize Google Colab. We use Google's Tesla K80 GPU, which is significantly more powerful than your integrated graphics cards on your laptops or desktops. Google Colab also already comes with all packages involved in this project, including Pytorch and Sklearn, saving the headache that is installation of Anaconda and the packages involved."

    "\n",
    "### Things you should try:\n",
    "- **Filter size**: Above we used 7x7; this makes pretty pictures but smaller filters may be more efficient\n",
    "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 32 filters. Do more or fewer do better?\n",
    "- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n",
    "- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster?\n",
    "- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for training\n",
    "For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and regularization strength. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
    "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
    "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
    "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going above and beyond\n",
    "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these; however they would be good things to try.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative update steps: For the assignment we implemented SGD+momentum, RMSprop, and Adam; you could try alternatives like AdaGrad or AdaDelta.\n",
    "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
    "- Model ensembles\n",
    "- Data augmentation\n",
    "- New Architectures\n",
    "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
    "  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n",
    "  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we expect\n",
    "At the very least, you should be able to train a ConvNet that gets at least 65% accuracy on the validation set. This is just a lower bound - if you are careful it should be possible to get accuracies much higher than that! \n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the space below to experiment and train your network. \n",
    "\n",

The material learned in this assignment is relevant to different parts of the data science community. Most likely not all of you will become AI researchers or data scientists, but perhaps little portions of AI can be used in future work, such as implementing simple features in other interdisciplinary fields. For example, if you had built a buy and sell application, using Pytorch to create a machine learning recommendation system is now feasible with the newfound knowledge gained in this project. Hopefully this project was useful in that perspective and gives a introduction to data science topics."
